### PLEASE READ ###

The extension was removed from the Chrome Web Store in 2009 by Google due to it's ability to bypass advertising. It will not be developed further, sorry for the inconvenience. If you'd like to host an extension update site and maintain and publish new versions, please get in touch directly (via email). Patches welcome, but I really need a maintainer to integrate them, as I have no time to spend on this project at this point.

This extensions contains a simple content script which replaces the standard Flash-based YouTube video player with HTML5's new video tag which natively supports video. Video played this way will be more efficient and require less CPU.

An attempt is made to automatically play the best format possible (HD if available). This version may be able to play all YouTube videos properly. It also and will not have any affect on videos embedded on other sites.

Please see the [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/youtube-html5-chrome/wiki/FAQ) before filing a ticket.
Also, please check the list of UpstreamBugs to see if the problem might actually be with Chrome itself.
